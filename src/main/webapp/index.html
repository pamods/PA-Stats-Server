		<h1>Welcome to PA Stats!</h1>
			<h3>What is this about?</h3>
			<div>PA-Stats is a statistics tracking page for Planetary Annihilation.<br/>
			It enables you to view your statistics like your army count over time or how many resources of what type you gathered.
			<br/>I am working on adding more features. You can click <a href="/listgames">Games</a> above to check the current list of games recorded.<br/>Recorded games should stay on the page IF they are longer than 5 minutes</div><br/>
			
			<h3>How does it work?</h3>
			<div>It works by gathering data from a UI-Mod<br/>
			The mod gathers your game data and sends it to this server every 5 seconds.
			The exchange of data between the mod and the server happens with a json webservice. If you have a nice idea for a tool that needs access to the data ask <a href="https://forums.uberent.com/members/cola_colin.5269/">me</a> for it.
