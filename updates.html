		</ul>
		<h4>v19.0.0 - 15.9.2014</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>the mappool is visible now in the System Designer. You can also access it by clicking the MAPS part in the title of the multiplayer screen</li>

			<li>new mappool, thanks to elodea for helping me with it!!!</li>
			<li>try to tell any 1vs1 interested player you may meet in custom games of the matchmaking system :)</li>
			<li>new icon for the page, stolen from Exodus Esports :p You may need to reload this <a target='_blank' href='http://pastats.com/static/img/favicon.ico'>Link</a> or clear your cache to see it.</li>
			<li>it is now tracked if a game was an automatch or not, so far this is only used for the number of so played automatches under Extra</li>
			<li>added the fields "endTime" and "isAutomatch" to the /report/winners webservice</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Replaced strategic icons - 12.9.2014</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I finally use the new icons that PA has since a few month. This means all units should now be displayed on the globe</li>
			<li>You probably will need to clear your cache to see them</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>v18.2.0 - 12.9.2014</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>removed gender specific language from the automatch gamesetup notifications</li>
			<li>remove the star wars map from the mappool</li>
			<li>added option to not play the ARE YOU READY sound once a match has been found</li>
			<li>changed how the team composition of games is captured. This is a pretty important part of data gathering, that is the number one reason for bugs that cause games to not report at all. This should fix issues with no color being captured or completely missing reports. If you see such errors in any way please report them!</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>v18.1.0 - 9.9.2014</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Completely rewrote the gamesetup code for 1vs1 automatches. It *should* be more reliable. If you often face resets and break downs please report them!</li>
			<li>New maps for 1vs1 automatches</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>v18.0.1 - 5.9.2014</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>This version includes skill based 1v1 matchmaking. If the game states there is somebody close to your rating searching it should take not longer than 3 minutes to find an opponent</li>
			<li>fixed some minor bugs</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>v17.5.3 - 1.9.2014</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>fixed a tiny bug that prevented PA Stats from sending any game data</li>
			<li>removed the channel palookingforgames from the ingame irc, it was empty all the time anyway, now people end up in #planetaryannihilation which has some people at least</li>
			<li>changed positioning of the IRC window to prevent some weird quirks</li>
			<li>Version detection is a pain that never really worked, I decided to remove it. This means that in future PTE builds PA Stats may or may not work and I won't fix it for PTE builds, though I may still use them to prepare for changes. The exception to this is the matchmaking, which will still check for a known version and only offer matchmaking in that version. Can't try to match people from different builds together afterall.</li>
			<li>removed the old main menu entry for automatches</li>
			<li>fixed the checkboxes at the start of the game to work again and be placed inside the messages bar</li>
			<li>fixed matchmaking, it's such an ugly piece of hackery, I am surprised it works really.</li>
			<li>I didnt touch the definitions for matchmaking planets. Looking for suggestions to replace them, they are probably imba/broken/whatever else bad might happen</li>
			<li>fixed the settings</li>
			<li>fixed a bug that resulted in replays starting again and again after using a replaylink</li>
		</ul>
